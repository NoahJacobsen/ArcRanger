# Arc Ranger
## The purpose
This game was created in a week as a self-driven, solo game jam, with a strict cut-off time. I gave myself these restrictions to dedicate time to practice with the game engine while completing a project from design to polish.

## The idea
The player's goal is to collect lightning bolts by driving their lance over static fields, triggering a strike. If they hit too many rocks, their run is over.


## Incomplete features
These polish features were planned, but ended up unachievable with my remaining time:
- **Music**: I wrote a short looping track, but was unable to add the audio streaming node in time. You can find the audio in `ArcRanger/audio/gathering.wav`
- **Lightning animation**: Whenever the player successfully scored, a lightning bolt would have struck from the top of the screen and connect with the lance's tip
- **Stun animation**: I ran out of time to bug test an animation that fails to play; whenever the bike hit a rock, the back tire would have bounced up. The animation spritemap can be found in `ArcRanger/assets/player_stun.png`

Some additional polish was planned as a stretch goal, including sound effects and a better terrain-to-sky texture transition, but the above list encompasses the remainder of my baseline vision for the game.

> **Will you add these features/complete the project?** It's highly unlikely, due to the nature of it being a game jam. I may, however, re-use the theme for a project down the line.

## Inspiration
The theme (and would-be audio) was inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH0FbBuPlaQ) music video. In it, people dressed in full-plate armour ride dirt-bikes, seemingly to get struck by lightning.

I discovered this music video around the time, and felt like this was a really cool aesthetic to try and work with.
